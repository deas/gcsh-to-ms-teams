From the preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue is a rollout on the configuration management system that manages and pushes configuration for multiple Google infrastructure systems. The roll out caused an increase in the task counts which overloaded the configuration management system as all tasks pulled the configuration at the same time.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Affected customers would have experienced delays in creating or modifying the configuration of Global External HTTP(S) load balancers, Cloud Armor and Cloud CDN.\n* App Engine Flexible apps might have failed to deploy.",
